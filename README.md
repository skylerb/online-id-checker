CS307 - Software Engineering Project
----------------------
Apache Tomcat Files have been added.
The webapp for us to work on will be in the directory.
    webapp/idcheck

I have left all the examples from the original apache downloads incase people want to to look at them.


Starting the server
----------------------
/bin/startup.sh
Run this on any linux pc @ the school. You can then check if the server is running by going to localhost:8080 in your web browser.

/bin/shutdown.sh
Will shutdown the server. Do this before you logoff so you don't keep the server running all day long.
